Beda’s information upon this head was neither
copious nor definite.

) 33. The monks 04 Laestingaeu fumished ma-
terials relative to the ministry 04 Cedd and
Ceadda, by whose preaching the Mercians were
induced to renounce Paganism (4, 13). The
history 04 this kingdom is obscure, and consists
04 an account 04 its conversion (§ 211), the suc·
cession of its sovereigns (§ 180, 224, 287, 397,
412), and its hishops (ᾖ 219, 220, 223, 258-
265, 272). The neighhouring state 04 Middle
Anglia, which, 14 ever independent of Mercia,
soon mergcd in it, is similarly circumstanced,
and we are perhaps indebted to its connexion
with the princes and hishops 04 Northumbria
for what is known 04 its early history (§ 210-

situated so near to the kingdom 04 Northumbria,
was both politically and ecclesiastically inde-
pendent 04 11, and Beda was as ignorant of the
transactions of that province as 04 those which
were much more remote from J arrow. He re-
ceived some materials from bishop Cynibcrct
(4, 26), but they appear to have been scanty,
for the circumstances which relate to Liucolnshire

other witnesses (5, 1; ᾗ 136, 180-183).

copious, and is derived partly from the com-
munications 04 Albinus and Nothhelm (4,1),0011
partly from the monks 04 Laestiugaeu (4, 15).
Το the first 04 these two sources we must pro-
bably refer the account 04 the pontificato 04
Mellitus (ᾗ 95, 99, 105), and the apostacy 04 the
sons of Saeberct (§103); circumstances too in-
