row, for some reason which we cannot now spe-¹
cisy, became the residence of Beda, and there he
spent the remainder os his life.

0 § 7. The institutione of the monastery in which

π’ Beda was educated, must have tended in an emi-

nent degree to supply him with that learning
for which he was so eminently distinguished.
Belonging to the order os St. Benedict, which,
beyond all othere, was calculated to promote at-
tachment to literature,¹ and possessing, as may
be presumed, a natural taste for study, hc was lor-
tunate in having access to a library of more than
ordinary extent and value. Benedict Biscop, the
first abbot of Wearmouth and J arrow, had paid
at least sour visits to the Papal Court, and had
each time returned to England laden with the
choiccst manuscripts and works of art which
Rome could furnish.² The dying abbot gave
particular instructions as to the preservation of

his collection os books ;3 and not only were
these instructions attended to, but additions were
made to the monastic library by his successore.4

A Benedictine monastery consisting of more than
six hundred⁵ monks‚ endowed with princely rc-
yenues,⁶ and govemed by an abbot who was
interested in the promotion of literature, must,
in all probability, have produced many eminent
men, whose studies and example were likely to
have an influencc on a young and enthusiastic
scholar.
