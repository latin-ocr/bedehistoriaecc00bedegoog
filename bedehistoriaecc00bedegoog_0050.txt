Papal Court was too short to be regarded as any

interruption to his residence in his own monas-

tery.¹

§ 11. Amidst such contradictory evidence upon rutenae a
a point so materially connected with the life iiiiaff‘
of our historian, it is satisfactory to he able to
show, for the first time, not only that the whole
story of Beda's summons to Rome is founded
upon an error committed by Malmesbury, but
also how that error has originated.

Besides the copy of the letter of Sergius to
Ceolfrith which Malmesbury has inserted in his
History, another is contained in one of the Cot-
tonian MSS. (Tiberius, A xv. fol. 6, b,) a volume
written in the early part of the eleventh cen-
tury, and therefore much earlier and of better
authority than Malmesbury. In that manuscript

the letter stands as follows.²
512. ‘Sergius episcopus servus servorumcopy or aa

Dei, Ceolfrido religioso abbati presbyteroque,³ hilm.
salutem.'

‘ Quibus verbis et modis clementiam Dei nostri
atque inenarrabilem providentiam possumus effari,
et dignas gratiarum actiones⁴ pro immensis circa
nos ejus beneficiis persolvere, qui in tenebris et
umbra mortis positos ad lumen suae scientiae pro-
ducit ..... Bencdictionis interea gratiam, quam
nobis per praesentem portitorem tua misit devota
religio, libenti et hilari animo, sicuti ab ea directa

est, nos suscepisse cognosce,⁵ et pro ejus nimirum
