GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

§L Ir1s the object of Tun Enonrsu Hrsro- pptrpcpn
nient Socrnru to print an accurate, uniform, and soero ιιι-ι ιι
eleg ‹rant edition os the most valuable Englishomen
Chronioles from the earliest period to the ac
cession os Henry the Eighth. Together with
these, it proposes to publish‚ simultaneously‚ a
few additional volumeS, containing the most iin-
portant Lives of Saints‚ Letters, State Papers,
Historical Poems, the Proceedings of Councils
and Synods, Papal Bulls‚ and Decretal Epistles.

§2 The English Chronioles hitherto publish ἰιιιιιιιὶιῐι maanor
ed are, for the most part, to be found only 1n the t
oostly‚ inconvenient, and unsatisfactory collec
tions ofParker, Savile, Camden, Duchesne, Twys-
den, Gale, Fell, and Hearne. The important
treatise of Giraldus CambrensiS, ‘De Instruc-
tione PrincipiS‚' and the continuation of Hove-
den's hanah, are printed only in Bouquct’s ‘Re-
cueil des Historiens des Gaules' The ‘Gesta
Regis Stephani' occur only in Duchesne’s ‘ His,
toriae Normannorum Scriptores Antiqui ;' and
the Chroniclc os Ralph of Coggeshale is only
to be met with in Bouquet’s voluminous work,
or in the ‘ Amplissima Collectio' of Martene and
Durand.

§3. An objection still more serious than that
above noticed is, that the texts os many of our
Chronioles 'have been founded upon manuscripts
