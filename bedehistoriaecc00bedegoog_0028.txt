cumstanced3 hut that it had their approbation,
and would, if possible, have been pursued by
them, appears plain srorn a remark prelixed to
the ‘Itinerarium Cambriae' os Giraldus Cam·
hrensis (edit. Camden, p. 818). Selden and
Watts, the editors 61 the ‘Decem Scriptores’
and 61 Matthew Paris, were influenced, as we
learn from the prefaces to their respective works,
hythe same considerations. Discussions upon
ecclesiastical history and points 61 doctrine were
in their time frequent between the Seminary
Priests and the memhers 61 the Church 61 Eng-

same reasons did not exist, and accordingly we
find that the judieious Wharton in his ‘Anglia
Sacra' systematically rejects such passages as
did not corne within the immediate scope 61 his
work (vol. i. pp. 221, 265, 267, 270, 345, 358,
361, 510; ii. 257, 265, 269, dcc.) or were found to

pp. 225-228, 232-241, 245, 313, 342, 501-
-508; ii. 213, 217, 219, 221, 247.) 01 the same
mind was Gale, who, in his ‘Viginti ScriptoreS,'
had the good sense to strike out of his edition 61
Higden all passages which did not hear upon the
history 61 our country. But the examples thus
given were lost upon Hearne, who appears to
have been incompetent to form a correct estimato
61 the relative value of any work on which he
was employed; and yet, in his edition 61 Brunne’s
translation 61 Langtoft, even Heame ‘concludes
it to be a needless piece 61 service to publish any
61 the first part,' finding it a mere abridgement
