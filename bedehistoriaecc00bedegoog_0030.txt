from this principle are found almost to counter-
balance the inconveniences to which those who
consult that work are subjected by the division
of authors into periods.

§la These authorities are conceived to he
more than sufficient to warrant that mode of pub·
lishing the English Chronicles which this Socicty
has resolved to follow, even if a plan so obvious
and reasonable in itself could bc supposed to re-
quire precedent to support it.

§ 17. Having thus presented an outline of the ffl‘lss'ss'
plan, some observatione upon the mode of publi· adeo ’ '
catiou become necessary. It is proposed that
the authors to be printed shall appear in the
chronological order in which they wrote. The
whole historical works of each author will be
printed together3 but it is proposed that, whercver
practicable, each work shall have a separate title

and pagination, so asto admit of being bound in

any way that may be thought desirable. As
somemembers may preferachronologicalarrange-
ment of subjects to that of authors, such an ar·
rangement will thus be facilitated. Advantage,
if necessary, will be taken by the Editors ap-
pointed by the Socicty, os the liberty allowed

thern of departing in some instances from strict
chronological order, since this indulgence will
enable them, hythe temporary postponement of
the publicationes an author, to overcome the
difficulties which, if they followed a different
plan, would otherwise arise from the extent of
the undertaking, or the scarcity or dispersion of
the manuscript copies Such deviatione from
chronological arrangement will proceed only from
urgent causes, and will lead ultimately to the
appearance of the work so delayed in a more
complete form.
