lN'l'RODUCTION. XXXV

Tbey¹ have been occasionally consulted, as well
as the editions prior to Smith's, but always with·
out conferring any important benefit. With such
guides as the Cambridge and the two Cottonian
manuscripts, it has been thought wholly unneces·
sary to insert the readings of MSS. of a character
decidedly inferior.

§44 The Anglo-Saxon version of this His· monbr-
tory, usually ascribed to King Alfred, has been ⁸
compared with the original, and the variations
between the two texts have been noticed. The

¹ Translator has omitted some passages (§ 22, 24
-26, Suc), amplified others (§ 23, 27, 30, 172,
dre), and sometimes wholly departed from our
present Latin text (§ 175), perhaps upon good
authority. It was thought that these variations
were worthy of being pointed out to the Reader.

§la osche Notes subjoined to the present Notesc-
edition it does not become the Editor to speak.
They contain the whole of what seemed valuable
in Smith's excellent AnnotationS, to which nu-
merousadditions have been made srom other
sources, which the researcbes of the last century
have laid open for the illustration os early Eng-
lish history. The Chronology adopted in his
edition has frequently been altered in this, but
seldom or never without giving the reasons sor
such alteration. Upon the whole, it is hoped
that the present Edition will he found to be
more correct, ample, and convenient, than any
which has yet been given to the Public.
