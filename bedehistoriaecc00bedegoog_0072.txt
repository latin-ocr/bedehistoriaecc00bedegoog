seded by the admirable edition of Smith,¹ the na-
ture and merite of which it may be proper to
explain somewhat fully.

§42 The text of the Historia Ecclesiasticagfflfl'· ⁶¹¹¹·
is founded upon a manuscript formerly belong-
ing to More, bishop of Ely, and now deposited in
the Public Library at Cambridge (K. k, 5, 16).
Smith infers, from a short chronological merno-
randum affixed to the manuscript, that it was
written in the year 737, consequently within two
years of Beda's¹ death3 but whether this be
strictly correct or not, More's manuscript is
certainly the most valuable copy of Beda in ex-
istence. Smith also collated two manuscripts in
the Cottonian library (Tiber. G. 11. and A. x1v.)‚
and one in the Royal Library, and had referred
· to at least forty others (see his Appendix‚ p. 660).
The notes to this edition are frequently copied
from Archbishop Usher’s Primordia,² and many
of the remainder were written by Gale, who had
made preparations for a new edition of the His-
toria Ecclesiastica,³ but enough remain to show
the learning, industry, and judgement of the two
Editors.
