XX GENERAL INTRODUGTION. .

vilege of examining the Papal ‘Regesta‚’ that
they abound in letterS, an acquaintance with
which seemed to him almost indispensable to a
correct knowledge of our early history. Means-
will be taken to obtain correct transcripts of these

been taken to secure the transmission of faithful
copies of those deposited in the Frcnch arohives. ’
