ciety to reject altogether th⁶ose portions of this
sort of preliminary compilation which are un-

give othere, which have evidently been copied
by one chronicler from another, only in the au·

in an unique copy of a writer so incorporated;
and the additionS, alterations, and omissions‚
which a secondary writer may make in the nar·
rative of a primary one, are entitled to preser-
vation, as they may originale in different views,
or may bc the result of more accurate informa·
tion. The passages which, from the causes pre-
viously stated, it may be considered advisable to
remove, will, where necessary, be employed in

' furnishing Various Readings to the text of the

original author, and the changes made in such
extracts by the writer who has incorporated them
'will be noticcd. Whilst, however, such parts of
the narrative of our Chronicles will in general be
given only in the author in which they first ap-
pear, an exception will be made in favour of
those passages which seem either to consist of
' original information, to be founded upon autho-
rities now lost, or to be worthy of preservation
from. any other reasons, As it may be curicus in
the history of Literature to mark the kind of
reading which was popular at each period, and
important to notice the relative degrees of credit

attached at intervening periods to pre-existing
