the Capture of Bayeux and the Battle ol the
Standard, Minot’s poems‘ upon the principal
events of the reign of Edward the Third, and the
poetical narratiyes by Gower and Maydstane of
the insurrections in the time of Richard the Se-
cond.

ᾗ 34. That the motivas and objects of this So-
ciety may not be misunderstood‚ it becomes ne-
cessary to remark, that it neither wishes nor in-
tends to oppose, nor to interfere with, the ‘Cor-
pus Historicum‚’ sanctioned by Parliament in ⁴
1822; the first volume of which is understood to
be on the eve of publication. With the highest
opinion of the talents and acquiremcnts of the
gentleman to whom the editorship of that work
has been entrusted‚ it is conlidently' expected
that, to many, the plan of arrangement here pro·
posed will present superior recommendations.
The ‘ Corpus Historioum' is stated* to be formed
upon the plan adopted by Bouquet‚ and is there-
fore liable to the same objections. lts publica-
tion in large folio, the division of many of the
authors into sections, separated sometimes from
each other by even five intervening volumeS, the
delay which must necessarily occur in the execu-
tion of such a plan, and the impossibihty of ob-
taining any one author in a separate form, all
draw a strong line os distinction between it and

the present undertaking, and absolve the Eng-
lish Historical Society from the imputation ol in-
truding upon a field already occupied.
