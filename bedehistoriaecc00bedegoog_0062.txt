the commencement of the work to the conver-
sion of the Saxons to Christianity (§ 4-51), is
gleaned, as Beda himself informs us (§ 2), from
various writers. The chief sources for the de·

scription of Britain (ᾗ 4-9) are Pliny, Solinus, .

Orosius, and Gildas3 st. Basil is also cited (ξ 5);
and the traditions which were current in Beda’s
own day are occasionally introduced (9, 29; 10,
3.) The history of the Romans in Britain (§ 9-
34) is founded chiefly upon Orosius, Eutropius
and Gildas, corrected, however, in some places
by the author, apparently from tradition or
local information (§9,13‚2s‚ 29, 30), and aug-
mented by an account of the introduction of
Christianity under Lucius (ᾗ 12), of the martyr-
dom of st. Alban, copied apparently from some
legend (ξ 16-99), and of the origin of the Pela-
gian heresy(§25)‚-all of them circumstances inti-
mately connected with the ecclesiastical history of
the island. The mention of Hengist and Horsa,
and the allusion to the tomb of the latter at Hor-
stead, renders it probable that the account which
Beda gives of the arrival of tho Teutonic tribeS,
and their settlement in England (§ 35, 36), was
communicated by Albinus and Nothhelm. Itis

purely fabulouS, being, in fact, not the history, ¹
but the tradition, of the J utish kingdom of Kent,
as appears from circumstances mentioned else-
where in this work (§ 44), as well as from the
authorities there quoted. The two visits of Ger-
manus to England (ᾖ 39-49), so important in
the history of its religion, are introduced in the
very words of Constantius Lugdunensis, and must
therefore haye been copied from that author. The
ante-Augustino portion of the history is termin-
ated by extracts from GildaS, relative to the con-

flicts between the Saxons and Britons (§239, 50).
