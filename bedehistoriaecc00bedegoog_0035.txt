formed, we gain an insight into the medical
knowledge of the day; and it may be affirmed that
there rs scarcely a legend, however absurd, from
which some information may. not be gleaned. ·
§24 But, while thus expressing a general
opinion upon the value of Lives of the SaintS,
it must not be concealed that some of these
· ‘Acta' are not worthy of preservation, and that
in others the information which they contain is
hidden beneath a mass of irrelevant matter. It
becomes necessary, therefore, to use some dis-
cretion in themode of editing3 and it has been
resolved, while care shall be taken to preserve
whatever can he useful, to reject what is obvi-
ously useless By omitting what is mere ver-
biage, it is frequently possible to retain all the
facts recorded, without altering a single word
which the author has written. It need scarcely
be stated, that whatever illustrates the civil or
ecclesiastical state of the times shall be rigidly
preserved, and that' nothing which contains any
allusion to the subjects we have referred to shall
be suppressed. This practice upon which, for ’
obvious ressone, the J esuits, Bollandus and his
successore, and Mabillon* the Benedictine, did

¹ not venture, is not supposed to stand in need of

any justification3 but, if necessary, we might cite
Ι the examples of Wharton and Bouquet to autho-
rise its adoption.

§25 These Lives being sor the most part
anonymous, it has been resolved to arrange them
according to the period at which the subject of
the biography lived. Such legendS, however, as
are ascertained to have been written hy authors

Mabillon, however, didsome· of his ‘,Acta’ sect. xi. and
times ab ridgethe1 miracles. See vol i. p. 3412111519 204),
