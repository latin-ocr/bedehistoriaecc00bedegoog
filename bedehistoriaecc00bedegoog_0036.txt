whose historical works occur in the series of
Chronicles, will find aplace in that series. For
instance, the Life of David by Giraldus Cambrensis
.will not be disjoined from his other productions3
the Legends of Ninian, Edward the Confessor‚
and David King of Scotland, written by Ailred
of Rievaulx, will accompany his history; the
biographies written hy Eadmer will he associated
with the ‘Historia Novornm,' although relative
to widely different periods of history. But, as
has been previously stated, measures will be
adopted, where practicable, to admit of a dif-
ferent arrangement by those who may prefer it.

§26. Before leaving this division of the sub·
ject, it may be remarked, that our literature can
furnish us only with John of Tynmouth's ‘Nova
Legenda Angliee,' printed under the name os
Capgrave, in 1516, by Pynson, and the second
volume of Wharton’s ‘ Anglia Sacra ;' the first a
mere abridgcment, the second a selection. The
great works of Surius in six volumes, of Bol-
landus and his successore in fifty-three volumes,
(yet incompleta) and of Mahillon in nine vo-
lumeS, (also incomplete,) all in folio, are searful
additions to the numerous works to be consulted
hy the student of early English History.

cils contain much which comes within the plan
of the Society. The affairs of Chureh and State
were at an early period so involved together, that
it is impossible to understand the one without the
other. Councils contain the most authentic re-
cord os assemblies which legislated for the se·
cular as well as the ecclesiastical power, andin

the NormanConquest theselections willbecopiouS,
but from that period they will be more sparing.
