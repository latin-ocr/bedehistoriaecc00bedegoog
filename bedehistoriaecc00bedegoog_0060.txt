§25. Beda's reputation speedily extended οριιιιι ι
itself over Europe. Boniface, the Apostle offfiw'
Germany, Beda’s contemporary, designated himm'
as the candle sent by God for the spiritual illu-
mination of the church, and requested to have,
copies of some of his works for his own spi-
ritual edification.¹ The like request was fre-
quently urged by LulluS, the successor os Boni·
face in the see of Meutz, who presented to Cuth-
berht, abbot of J arrow, (the author, of the letter
given at § 16,) a eloth of silk, in which to place
the relies of his sainted master.² Towards the
eud of the same century in which Beda died,
his praises were frequently and warmly cele-
brated by Alcuin, and his sanctity was supposed
to be established hy the miracles which were
believed to be performed by his relies.³ It is
uunecessary to cite the testimonias to that effect

which might be collected from the writings of
· Benedict of Anagni (ΑΙ). 821), Hildewin (ΑΙ).

, 842), W alefrid Strabo (Aa). 849), Paschasius
Radbertus (AD 851), Lupus (A..D 861), Hinc-
mar of Rheims (A. Ι). 882), and others. The
epithetof‘Venerablessbywhich he hasbeen εοξιιιιιωξξιιΙ
universally distinguished, and which rs alone suf·
ficient to testify the estimation' ιιι which he was
held, appears first to have been bestowed upon
him in the niuth century, and is frequently em-
ployed by Amalarius of Treves (A.D. 814), J o-
nas, bishop of Orleans (A. D. 843), and other
authors of the same period.
