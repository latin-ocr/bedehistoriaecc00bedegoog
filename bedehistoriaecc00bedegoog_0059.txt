'³0¹⁸‘ ffiy became of the greatest importauce, even in a pe-
ῐῗιιιιιιιΙ cuniary point of view, to the establishment m
which they were preserved, by attracting to his
'shrine a crowd of visitors with offerings The
cupidity‚ or jealousy, of the neighbouring church
of Durham was excited; and a presbyter, named
AElfred, the sou os Weston, actually stole the
bones of our historiar, and deposited them 'in
' the cathedral church in which they now re-
main.¹ When the relics of st. Cuthberht were
translated, in the year 1104, the bones os Beda
were discovered in the same coffin,² from which ·
they were then removed‚³ and were, some few
years afterwards, placed by Hugh Pudsey, bishop
of Durham, in a casket of gold and silver, in that
partos the cathedral erected by him, still called
the Galilee,⁴ who caused the following lines to
be inscribed over them.⁵

‘Continet haec theca Bedae Venerabilis ossa;
Sensum factori Christus dedit, aesque datori.
Petrus opus fecit, praesul dedit hoc Hugo donum;
Sic in utroque suum veneratus utrumque patronum!

In November 1541, the bones of Beda were
removed with other relies from the Cathedral
Church os Durham. The fate of the rich casket
of Bishop Pudsey may easily be imagined3 but
the stoue on which it rested is still existing,

transferssred to the south side of the nave of the
church.
