GENERAL lNTRODUOTION. V

ever supersede the crude and capricious extracts
made from them, centurias ago, by the credulous
and inexact annalist of a monastery.

§a It may also be remarked, that many of
our Chronicles are found to embrace copious ex-
tracts from preceding English authorities, which
authorities still exist. To such a length was this
system of appropriation carried, that in some in·
stances whole peges of one author were trans·
ferred, without acknowledgment, into the nar-
rative of another. For instance, Asser’s Life os
Alfrcd is included in Florence of Worcester ; con·
siderablc porticus os Florencc are in Simeon of
Durham 3 Simeon, in his turn, is copied by Hove-
den3 a considerable part of what is called the
Chronicle of Benedictus Abbas is to be sound in
Hoveden and Brompt0n3 Knighton incorporatos
a large share of Hemingford; and Walsingham
is such aplagiary‚ that, if he were resolved into ι
-his component partS, scarcely a vestige of him
would remain, instead os occupying, as he now
does, 550 closely-printed folio pagos,

ᾗ 9. These facts either have not been observed
by the editors of our early ChronioleS, or, if ob-
served, have unfortunatelybeen disregarded. Mo-
dern Historians have a right to expect that the
carly authorities, upon which their narrative must
be founded, should be presented to thamin such
astate ofclcarness and compression, as to be
applicable, with the least possible trouble, to the

purposes sor which they are intended. But such ⁴
facilities have not hitherto been presented; and
if their absence has given rise to instances of
misapprehension in the pagos of even our best
modern writers, they may in justice be regarded
only as the unsuspecting followers of what they
naturally concludcd to be authentic.
