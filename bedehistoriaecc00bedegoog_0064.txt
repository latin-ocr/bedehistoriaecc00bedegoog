INTRODUGTION. XXV

Diaconus (§ 82); the miracles os Ethelhurg,
abbess os Barking (ᾖ 275-282); the Life of
Sebbi, king of East Saxony (ᾗ 283); the Legend
of Fursey (ξ 204, 208); and that of Cuthberht of
Lindissarn (ᾗ 346), formerly written by Beda,
but now augmented by himself, with additional
facts. These, together with some extracts from
the Treatise oi Arcuuls De locis sanctis (ᾗ 404-
407), are all the¹ written documents to which
'the author refers.

Bcda's possession, of which he has made liberal
use, is certain from his express words (4, 21),
and may also be inferred from internal evidence.
Albinus and Nothhelm appear to have furnished
