tion which it furnishes is of little valne, since it
merely retails, in inflated language, the particu-
lars mentioned by Beda regarding himself, and
the monastic establishments with which hc was
connected. ’
m⁰ § 3. Simeon of Durham, notwithstanding his
⁸ local advantages, contents himself with inserting
in the first book of the Ecclesiastical History
of that see,¹ almost in Beda’s own wordS, an
account of the erection of the monastery of
· J arrow, an extract from his introduction to
the Historia Ecclesiastico, a list of his writ-
ings, and, lastly, a copy of Cuthberht’s letter to
Cuthwine, descriptiva of Beda's last moments.
Simeon mentions incidentally the translation os
Beda's remains at Durham, (of which we know,
from other authority, that he was an eye-wit-
nesS,²) and that the portico of a church at J ar·
row had been dedicated to him. From this wri-
ter we also learn that there existed in his day
a ‘mansiuncula’ of stone, in which report said
that the Saint had been accustomed to study
and to meditate.³

pygiyssgllypreserved at Cheminon, in Franco, a short life

of Beda, which professes to be written by one

 

Anthony, his disciple. This life agrees ,very
closely, in facts, arrangement, and diction, with
the production of Simeon3 and, as it also contains
an allusion to Beda's translation at Durham, it
must have been written, or at least interpolated,
during, or after, the twelfth century.
