X ' GENERAL lNTRODUGTION.

candid and just criticism passed by wilkins, in
his prelace to Tanner's ‘ Bibliotheca Britannico-
Hibernica,' upon the early historiens edited by
the Oxford antiquary is valuable sor our present
object, inasmuch as it shows that the low esti-
mation in which many of these works were held
by one whose opinion is entitled to so much re-
spect, originated solely in the want of discretior
which Hearne evinced in reprinting information
which previously existed in a form equally or
more authentic (see numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12,
25, 27). Maepherson, too, in his admirable edi·
tion of Wyntoun's Chronicle‚ tells us, ‘that in
order to save his readers the labour of wander-
ing through a wilderness of Asiatic‚ Greek, and
Roman history, in search of minute notices con-
cerning Scotland or Britain, he has caresully se-
lected all that in any respect concerns the Bri- ·
tish Islands‚ whether truc or fabulouS,’ and that
‘this separation os the useful from the useless
has had the approbation of some of the best
judges of Scottish history! (Pref. p. viii.) We
have to thank the same authority for expressing
so forcibly the wish thata future editor of For·
dun’s Scotichronicon would take the trouble of
selecting the few sentences which are useful, and
of suppressing the vast quantity ol lumber which
loads that work and distresses the reader. (Ibid.)

§la Continental scholars have seen the ne-
cessity of adopting a similar process, and have
acted accordingly. It is well known that the
chief merit of the great national collection of
French Historians* commenced by Bouquet‚
consists in this systematic reference os informa-
tion to its source, and that the benefits resulting
