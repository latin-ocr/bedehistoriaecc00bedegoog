speak of himself as a compiler, and assumes the
character of an Historian, it becomes incumbent ·
upon us to examine into the sources upon which
hc has founded this, by lar the most interesting
portion of his History. The materials which he
employed seem to have consisted of (1.) written
documents, and (11.) verbal information. (1.)
The written materials may be divided into (1.)
Historical information drawn up and communi-
cated by his correspondents sor the express pur-
pose of being employed in his work, (2.) docu-
ments pre-existing in a narrative form, and (3.)
transcripte of official documents

,Yffim‘ §30. (1.) That Beda's correspondents drew
up and communicated to him information which
he used when writing this history, is certain
from what he states in its Prologue (3, 2;
4, 25); and it is highly probable that to them
we are indebted sor many particulars connected
with the history of kingdoms situated to the
south of the river Humber, with which a monk
of J arrow, from his local position, was pro-
bably unacquainted. Traces os the assistance
which he derived from Cantcrbury are percep-
tible in the minute acquaintance which he ex-
hibits not only with the topography os Kent(§54),
but with its condition at the time when he wrote
(ᾗ 148, 449, &c.); and the same remark is appli-
cable, although in a more limited degree, to most
of the other southern kingdoms (ᾗ 289, 298, 299,
300, 314, &c.)

(2.) Documents pre-existing in an historioal
sorm arc scldom quoted: amongst those of
which use has been made may bc numbcred the .
Life os Gregory the Great, written by Paulus
