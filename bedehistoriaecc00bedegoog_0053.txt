fflfflhfffl 515. Beyond the few circumstances which
have now been mentioned, there is nothing of
any moment to add respecting the history of
Beda. His life seems to have glided on in the
undisturbed tranquillity of monastic seclusion‚
occupied alternately in the duties os rehgion and
in the service of literature, and consequently di-
versified by none of those changes of scene or
occupatiori which furnish the materiale for hio-
graphy. His death¹ was as quiet and holy as
his lise; and we cannot refrain from laying before
our readers the affecting picture which has been
drawn by one of his disciples who was present

. at his decease.
