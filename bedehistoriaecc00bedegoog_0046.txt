§5. The compilers 01 the Acta Sanctorum rum
have inserted m that 110111Ι a life of Beda, which a rua “¹¹¹
is only, as they remark, a series 01 extractss aii‘i dhis
from Simeon of Durham and Beda himself; aps¹ ‘m‘
pended to which rs Cuthherht’s letter to 6601-
frith. They refer to another account, which they
did not think it advisable to print, in conse·
quence of the fables with which it was inter-
spersed. The same character may be given to
the legend inserted in the compilation 01 John
Capgrare.2 Beyond these materials we have no
other information regarding the life 01 Beda, ex-
cept a few particulare which will be noticed in
the following memoir.

§ 6. The Venerable Beda was born 111 the yearnm My· 11-
674‚'³ 1n the district which then belonged to theru,
> Benedictine monasteries 01 Wearmouth and 101-
1011,4 now forming part of the coun y 01 Durham.
011116 name, condition, or history 01 his parents,
nothing is known; hut it may be inferred that
he was left an orphan in his childhood, since he
tells us that, when only seven years old, he was
placed ‘eura propinquorum,' under the care of
Abbot Benedici, who then appears to have
presided 0161 the monastery 01 Wearmouth.
How long he remained in that situation is
uncertain. The neighbouring establishment 01
J arrow was founded by the same 1061116161,ςο-
vemed hythe sameRule, and placed under the
same ahbot as Wearmouth; the monks were in-
timately connected with each other, and lived
upon terms of the most perfect harmony. 161-
