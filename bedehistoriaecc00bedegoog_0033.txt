Libraries Supposing the modern historian has
made himself acquainted with the titles of such
works as he believes may contain documents cou-
uected with his researcheS, he will soon find that
a proper examination of these ponderous vo-
lumes, (which he is seldom able to consult athis
own residence,) demands the sacrifice of more

time and trouble than he can well bestow upon

· the collection of materiale. Even had we the

benefit of works similar to those with which Le
Long and Brequigny have enriched the literature
of Franco, this portion of the Society's plan would
still be worthy os the national patronage. At
present, however, left as he is without a solitary
guide to direct his inquiries the investigator of
our early history may be presumed to be doubly
grateful for having those materials presented to
him in a full and arranged form, which it would
otherwise have cost him so much labour and
anxiety to collect.

§2L The documents which it is intended to
print along with the Chronicles may be divided
into Lives of Saints, Proceedings of Ecclesiasti-
cal Councils, LetterS, CharterS, Bulls, State ·
PaperS, and Historical Poems. It may be ne-
cessary to make a few remarks on the nature
and importanoe of each of these classeS, audon
the manner in which they will be edited.

⁰ §22 From the dawn of our history to the

thirteenth century there is scarcely a reign upon
which the lives of saints do not throw important·
light, and sometimes they are the only source
whence information upon points os much moment
can be derived. Regarded in an historical point
of view, the individuale whose biography is re-
corded frequently possess no inconsiderable claim
