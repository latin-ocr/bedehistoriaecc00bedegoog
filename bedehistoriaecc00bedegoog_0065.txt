it appears (§ 294, 295) that the abbey of Selsey
possessed a volume in which were entered the
obits of eminent individuals; and the same ous-
tom probably prevailed throughout the other
monastic establishments of England.

§32 The history of the diocese of Rochester
was communicated by Albinus and Nothhelm. It
is exceedingly barren of particulam (ᾖ 209, 287,
375); and probably would have been even more
so, had it not been connected with the life of
Paulinus of York (ᾗ 149, 187), concerning whom
Beda appears to have obtained information from
other quarters.

The early annals of East Anglia are equally
scanty, as we have little more than a short pe·
digree of its kings (§ 134), an account ol its
- conversion to Christianity(§ 134,135), the his·
tory of Sigiberot and Anna (§ 199, 201), and a
few particulars regarding its bishops‚ Felix, Tho-
mas, BerctgiIS, and Bisi (§ 209, 271), which de-
tails were communicated in part by Albinus and
Nothhelm (4, 1).

The history of the West Saxons was derived
partly from the same authorities (4, 1), and partly
from the information of Daniel, bishop of Win-
chester (4, 6). It relatas to their conversion by
Birinus (ᾗ 167-171), the reigns ο1 caedualla and
of Ini (§ 372, 373), and the pontificata of Vine
(§ 243), Aldhelm and Daniel (ᾗ 410). Το this last
named bishop we are indebted for a portion of

the little of what is known as to the early history
of the South Saxons and the Isle os Wight(4, 10),
the last os the Saxon kingdoms which embraced
the Christian saith. It relates to the conver-
sion of those districts by the agenoy ο1 1111111013
